# Restaurant Chatbot

A Python-based interactive chatbot for restaurant order management. Built as part of MDA 610 coursework, this program simulates a restaurant ordering system with the following features:

- Interactive menu display with categorized items and pricing
- Order processing with quantity selection and total calculation  
- Order history tracking with timestamp-based receipts
- Simple command-line interface with intuitive commands
- Persistent storage of order history in text format

The system uses basic data structures (dictionaries) and file I/O for data management, making it suitable for learning fundamental Python programming concepts.

## Usage

Run the program and use these commands:

- `1` or `menu` - View the restaurant menu
- `2` or `order` - Place a new order
- `3` or `history` - View order history  
- `4` or `help` - Display available commands
- `quit` - Exit the program
